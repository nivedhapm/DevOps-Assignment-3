Adding test cases
-----------------

Each test case consists of 4 files: three files with input data and one
file that contains the expected vertical alignment chosen by kdiff3.

Test data files should follow this naming convention:
 *_base.*
 *_contrib1.*
 *_contrib2.*
 *_expected_result.*

The test automatically detects files that follow this convention and executes the
test on these sets of files in alphabetical order.


Specifying expected alignment
-----------------------------

Each line in the alignment file corresponds to a line in the diff view of
kdiff3 and consists of the three line numbers from files A, B and C that are
put on that line in the diff view.

So for instance if file A contains two lines, file B is empty and file C
contains one line that is the same as the second line in A, kdiff3 may align
them like this in the diff view:

A:                   B:                 C:
something                               
something else                          something else

An alignment file for this alignment would look like this:
1 -1 -1
2 -1  1

As you can see -1 is used to indicate that a line in the diff view does not
contain a line from the input file.
